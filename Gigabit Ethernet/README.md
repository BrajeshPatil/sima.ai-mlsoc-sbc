# Gigabit Ethernet
This section explains the schematic design implementation of the Gigabit Ethernet using the DP83867 Ethernet PHY IC. This feature is added in our SBC so that the pilot can be able to communicate with other devices supporting Ethernet or get inbuilt access to the Internet and additional functionality can be added later as required.
