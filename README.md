# sima.ai_mlsoc_sbc
The Single Board Computer designed using the Sima.ai MLSoC is a part of a project that I did under ARTPARK. The SBC was designed in order to run computationally heavy softwares such as SLAM, VIO and Autonomous Guidance Systems. The Sima.ai MLSoC which is a state-of-the-art ML-based
SOC was selected.

This repository provides the design files for only the hardware part of the project.
